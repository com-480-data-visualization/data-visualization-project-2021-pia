"Tell me story, tell me story
Tell me story, remember what you said
You promised me you said you would
You got to give in, so I'll be good
Tell me a story then I'll go to bed

Oh, worry, worry, weary ends my day
Comes the time to go home without my raise in pay
Home by the fire where a man can just relax
Sippers there by the chair, not a worry, not a care
Along comes Junior swinging his little axe

Tell me a story, tell me a story
Tell me a story, remember what you said
Tell me about the birds and bees
How do you make a chicken sneeze?
Tell me a story then I'll go to bed

Came home so late one evening last July
Played a little poker the time had passed me by
Shoes in my hand and my darlin' wife in bed
Up the stairs sayin' a prayer
Then a voice comes through the air

Hi you there, daddy
Remember what you said

Tell me a story, tell me a story
Tell me a story, remember what you said
Tell me how your eye got black
Because the doorway hit you back
Tell me a story then I'll go to bed

Once upon a time I remember long ago
Don't go back in history, your memory's kinda slow
Stop your noisy talkin' until I finish with my tale

Once upon a, upon a what
Upon your back, you'll get a swat
Tell me about the fish you caught
That's was bigger than a whale

Tell me a story, tell me a story
Tell me a story, remember what you said
You promised me, you said you would
You gotta give in, so I'll be good

Here's a tale you'll never forget
(Tap, tap, tap)
Ouch, my tails all red
And now get up to bed

"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.

Then she came and sat down at my table
As she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you,
Take me away from here and be my man.""

Then I looked into her eyes and saw it
The reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on

Cutting deep down in our affairs.

In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie

I was taken to a place

I stood high by the mountain tops

Am I going crazy, or is this just a dream?

So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one, more time

In the other a glass

And raised it to her lips

"A-Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sittin' in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on the West Side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman sing a song

A pair of Forty-Fives made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
With a 5'9"" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all, yeah

Woo!

I saw her head out to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
And Charlie said ""I hope that you're able, boy
Hon', I'm telling you she knows where it's at""
Well, suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her ""Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared""

I've gotta be forgiving

"Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
3 conductors, 25 sacks of mail

All along the southbound odyssey, the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name, and freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Good morning America, how are you
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Dealing card games, with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keeping score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels, rumblin' 'neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman porters, and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpets, made of steel
And mothers with their babes asleep, are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning America, how are you
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Nighttime on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness, rolling down to the sea

But all the towns and people seem, to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again, the passengers will please refrain
This train got the disappearing railroad blues

Good night America, how are you
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son

Learned of love and ABCs
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees

We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed 
Were just seasons out of time

Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along

Was brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the back seat were scratches from
The marks of men her fortune she had won

Couldn't see through the tinted glass
She said: ""Home James"" and he hit the gas
I followed her to some darkened room
She took my money, she said: ""I'll be with you soon""

A queen and a three
And mumbled some words
That were so strange to me

And then she turned up
A two-eyed jack
My eyes saw red
But the card still stayed black

She said: ""The man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you
My advice is that you leave this place
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face""

Laughing and kissing 'till they saw the gun in my hand

Answering your mystical call

'cause I'm about to ruin

but yo I'm makin' money, see
so yo world I hope you're ready for me.
Now gather round
I'm the new fool in town
and my sound's laid down by the Underground.

And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee.

Look at me, I'm skinny

but ya can't get near me

'cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.

I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid

I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.

let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin',
jig around, shakin' ya rump,
and when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
tell him step off, I'm doin' the Hump.

Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that

'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'

Red beans and rice didn't miss her

Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic

Why does it have to be so damn tough?

To let these ghosts out of my skull

I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)

But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way

Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me

Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)

Go back to from whence you came (home)

Without the enlightenment of all my folks

And you was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty...

No one else can save me now but you

But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya 
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made 
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop

You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground 
Being lowdown
I do the showdown with any little ho' 'round (NO!)
I wanna know who you're believing
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheating
You said I know you're mister O.P.P man
You P.P man
Won't only see me man
You should've know that I ain't hitting the step
That I was with it a bit
Not to consider the rep (Heck!)
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty By Nature
Not cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark

You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way

One reason Hip Hop's the top today
Swerve what you heard
Cause I ain't baling no hay
Ain't chopping no crop
But still growing every day

Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Ill town
Drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns
Beat downs are found
Don't know me! Don't come around!

Tippy tippy pause
Some start creepin' up, I eat 'em up
Their styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That's the way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty's purr 
Now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof

Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy

I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly

And close your eyes and hit the switch

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high

I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggaz
I keep on searchin and I keep on lookin
But niggaz are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin like they evil
You don't understand about runnin with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggaz can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin
Ain't nobody worryin everybody's tryin
Nothing from nothin leaves nothin
If you wanna have somethin you better stop frontin
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by

"Regulators
We regulate any stealing of his property
We're damn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean, earn your keep!
Regulators! Mount up!

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G. was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 2-1-3

So I hooks a left on 2-1 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin' dice so I said ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said ""What's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""

Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won't 'cha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said ""Damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glance in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin'
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G.

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G. Child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""Ooh, I like your size""
She said ""My car's broke down and you sing real nice,
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

I'm tweaking
Into a whole new era
G-Funk
Step to this, I dare ya
Funk, on a whole new level

The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era

"Little somethin for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corrine

Verse One:

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up

Ooooh child things are gonna get brighter

Verse Two:

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains and pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
They say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
there ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

Chorus

Verse Three:

And uhh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't fall down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz

then you were rough
And take it out on me but that's about enough

I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad
But I don't want my kids to see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you ain't that sick? (Who you calling a bitch?)

What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head and you
Call yourself a ""Gangsta Bitch"" now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wilding, acting like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe...hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type (yeah)
Ain't none of this worth getting your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?

How much longer will you be mine? 
And i'ma tell ya, I don't like drama
So do I have to put my handcuffs on your mama

But I'd rather fuck you, boo
And make you say humdrum, tweedee dum
Humdrum don't succumb when I'm done, buckin' shit
One nation under a groove gettin down for the fuck of it
Tear the roof of this motherfucker like we did last night, son
And hit you with the bop gun

If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys
Playin with our toys

Under the sun, under the sun
So rough, so tough when I get down
The disco fiend with the monster sound
I wants to get fucked up when I'm chillin', whoa
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill-in
You let her funk me 'cause my funk is the best
Comin from the west
Kickin that shit be occupied, dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
Hittin them dips, cd skips but I'm straight
As I bounce, rock, skate, now I'll toast to that
If it's rough, make the girls say
""do that stuff! aw, do that stuff!""
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week
For the top gun, hit you with the bop gun

This is how we do it, it's Friday night
And I feel all right
The party's here on the West side

So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the Shaw 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, ""Monty, yo we made it!""

It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by

You gotta get your groove on
Before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (this is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (this is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flava (this is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be playa

You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G, the girls see I got the money
Hundred dollar bills y'all

If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64

Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6'8"" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good

There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
""You and OG are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash.""

Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand
Open up your mind and then open up your heart
And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart

'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way

Violence is spread worldwide and there's families on-the street
And we sell drugs to children now oh why can't we just see
That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay

'Cause she believes that love will see it through
And one day he'll understand
And he'll see me as a person and not just a black man

And maintain to leave blood stains 
So don't complain, just chill

Keepin' it real
Enables me to make another mill
Still brothers run up and try to kill at will 
But get popped like a pimple 
So call me Clearasil 
I wipe fools off the face of the earth 
Since birth, I've been a bad honey 
So let me tell ya what I'm worth 
More than a stealth bomba 
I cause drama, the enforcer 
Music floats like a flying saucer 
Or a 747 jet, never forget 
I'm the brother that keeps the girls' panties wet 
The mic gets smoked 
Once you hear the beat kick 
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick 
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'

Three, four for the dough 
Five for the host 
Six, seven, eight for Death Row

Of intellect, so I can collect respect 
Plus a check

To take of this business I need to attend to 
'Cause my rent's due
And the rap gang's my meal ticket 
So you goddamn right, I'm a kick it 
Or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King 
A black Casanova runnin' brothers over like Christine 
When I rock the spot 
With the flavor I got 
I get plenty of ass, so call me an astronaut 
As I blast pass another brother's ass who thought he was strong 
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong 
When I flow fools, know it's time to take a hike 
'Cause I grab the mike 
And flip my tongue like a dike 
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted 
Produce smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted

Hit up the block to where? (East 99)
I get with my nigga to get me some ye-yo
Double up, nigga, what you need?
We got weed to get P.O.D.-ed
Fiend for the green leaves
Give it up, it's the first for sure.
Better lay low, 'cause the po-po creep when they roll
So (Oh, no) break
If you can't get away, better toss that ye-yo
Keep your bankroll
Yeah, we havin' a celebration
Love to stay high, and ya better believe when it's time to grind
I'm down for mine, crime after crime
Fin to creep to the pad 'cause mom's got the grub on the grill

Watch and make sure no one snatches my check.""

And put it up in-a me pocket
Then I be hittin' the ninety-nine
To get me a dub for forty duckets
But ain't no bucket
Ride that Rita, hop on the ten to the Clair
Ready to get 'em up with-a me thugs, and I cash that dub
Man, I gotta get there
Playa-playa, holla, holla
St. Clair got much to offer
Whether it be weed on 93
Or off on the Glock-glock for some dollars
So get a bag of dope and a quarter roll, oh
Most all of my niggas got the same
And we gonna roll it all up to smoke it
Hittin' that reefer, hydro
Been known to cut, so fuck them po-po
Toss all that ye-yo with a bone and say ""Ho""

Try to slang on my corner, nigga, yous a goner
St. Clair niggas don't like that
And sellin' them dummies, makin' that money
Come back, nigga, get pap-pap
From the first to the fifteenth niggas smoke plenty weed
But I gotta save, gotta come up
Put my rocks in the cut
When I get high, nigga, blaze that blunt
Time to roll to the pad, count out my profits
And add it to the stash
Gotta watch my back, see, for niggas that's tryin' to rob me, fool
But never no shorts or no losses, dumpin'
Keepin' these niggas up off me
See, the whole block, spend a couple bills
Thugs smoke a lot of weed on the first

If you'll open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometime the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath

When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break

Know you in Heaven smilin' down
Watching us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
Till the day we meet again

Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe

Wish I could turn back the hands of time

"I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Remmy
I didn't mind it when he fucked me from behind
It felt fine 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the jeep
Told him ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, hoe hop
Raw top in my mans drop
Then this homey Jimmy, he's screamin' ""Gimme,""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Cold suckin' his dick, rockin' the mike
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand

Had a weed spot, used to pump African black

Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'

I jumped on his dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him

Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?

"Intro: Ma$e

Yo yo, this Ma$e, youknowhatI'msayin?
You got niggaz that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggaz that don't wanna see me rich
You got niggaz that's mad, cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggaz that just don't like me
You know, the, those P.H.D. niggaz
But you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though

But a lot of niggaz don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit
we come to bring it to y'all niggaz, me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever
Black Rob
If you wanna dance, we dance

Verse One: Ma$e

Now trick what? Lace who? That ain't what Ma$e do
Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face Boo, not behind your back
Niggaz talk shit, we never mind that
Funny, never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit, and make a nigga say, 'Rewind that'
Niggaz know, we go against the Harlem Jigalo
Getcha hoe, lick her low, make the bitch, hit the do'
I represent honies with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says, 'OK, my tint smoke gray'
No way, nigga leave without handin me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my 6
Niggaz outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship (uhh, uhh)

Chorus: sung by Notorious B.I.G.
spoken words by Puff

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated (say what?)
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded (ahehe)
I don't know why they hate us (yeah)
Is it our ladies? (uh-huh)
Or I drive Mercedes (uhh, uhh)
Bay-bee bay-BEE!

Verse Two: Puff Daddy

I was in one bedroom, dreamin of a million (yeah)
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling (that's right)
I was a gentleman, livin in tenements
Now I'm swimmin in, all the women that be tens (hoo)
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins (uh-huh)
Hoes of all complexions, I like cinnamon
Ma$e you got some hoes well nigga, send em in (c'mon)
What you waitin for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Ma$e: Nah Puff, that's a Benz)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way
it's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous, how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there girlfriend I'm ticklish (heheh)
And I be switchin fees with a wrist full of G's
Nigga please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

Chorus

Verse Three: Puff Daddy, Ma$e

Now Puff rule the world, even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies come (yeah)
Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggaz wouldn't dare put they faces (c'mon)

Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my third dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the mami chochi and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar (yeah)
And everywhere I drive I'm a star, little kids
all on the corner scream, 'That's my car!'

It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I.
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I. (uh-huh)
Rock tons of gold, nuff money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred out the toe

Chorus w/ Puff talking while B.I.G. sings
You know, sometimes I gotta
ask myself
Why's there so much jealousy
in the world?
Don't look at mine, get
yours

A few questions that I need to know
How you could ever hurt me so
I need to know what I've done wrong
And how long it's been going on
Was it that I never paid enough attention?
Or did I not give enough affection?
Not only will your answers keep me sane
But I'll know never to make the same mistake again
You can tell me to my face
Or even on the phone,
You can write it in a letter
Either way I have to know
Did I never treat you right?
Did I always start the fight?
Either way I'm going out of my mind
All the answers to my questions I have to find

Melanie:
My head's spinning
Boy I'm in a daze

Don't wanna communicate

Deep within my soul
For all the answers
Don't wanna hurt no more

Need to be
Free from pain
Going insane

"Intro: Notorious B.I.G.

One, one two
Check me out right here ya'll

Verse One: Puff Daddy

Yo, the sun don't shine forever
(BIG: You can turn the track up a little bit for me)
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
(BIG: All up in my ears)
Better now than never, business before pleasure
(BIG: The mic is loud, but the beats isn't loud)
P-Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
(BIG: YEAH!)
So when you hear somethin, make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin
(BIG: YEAH! Now the mic is lower, turn the mics up)
Our music keeps you movin, what are you provin?
(BIG: Turn that shit all the way up, yeah)
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
(BIG: Music's gettin louder)
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby
(BIG: This shit is hot!)
Talkin crazy ain't gonna get you nuthin but choked
(BIG: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And BIG you know you too hard for these cats
I'm a wing cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin up facts (uhh) you rakin up plats

Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.

In a Commision, dont  ask for permission to hit em
He don't like me, him and wild wifey was wit em
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of ... (Satan) ... they say my killin's too blatant
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin
Duct tapin, your fam destiny
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal
Gun rest under the vest by the abdominal
hum a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The mo shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic
Parked in quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Underboss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank White

Chorus: Busta Rhymes

We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggaz is at? (2X)
Where the fuck my bitches at?
Where my bitches is at?
(repeat all 2X)

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

Verse Four: Notorious B.I.G.

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heatas n the two-seaters, with two midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the kids, Peniro, sheek loops
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him
Niggaz step up, we just macin them
placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy
Business rise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition
Nother day in the life of the Comission

Chorus 2X w/ Puff talking
Aiyyo, can you hear me out
there?
Aiyyo turn me up, nobody
can hear me out there
That's good, it's all fucked

Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on southbeach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom

And scatter like ice from the spoon

And the love you never knew
What's the things they never showed you

"You better count your money
Ghetto cowboy

The name is Krayzie ""Big Bad Ass"" Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole, along
With some cash, even took the mayor's daughter

Now, that there's kidnappin', but she was with it so I brought her
Then, got myself into a whole heap of trouble, double-crossed by the law
So there's nobody to run to, yeah, it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun
Outlaw--call him Leather Face

I'm headed for the West, heard they got
A couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well, uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown

So, I continue my mission it's gettin' dark
So I'm watchin' for them damn Injuns
They like to catch ya, then they rob and split
I be a rootin'-tootin'-shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips

All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse""Whoa, Nellie! Who in the bushes?
You better speak out or I'm a let my shotgun song sing out""
Who is this? I hope this ain't the law
Jump out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun

""C'mon out, right now, I'm gettin' angry""
Took a step back, 'cause it could get dangerous
Thug Queen, ""the horse stealer""
""Please don't shoot it's just me, Thug Queen, the horse-stealer""

""Then, why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes?""
""I'm wanted in four counties for armed robbery
Killed to two sheriffs, six of his best men with my hand, stole two horses
Thought you was the law, that's why I jumped in the bushes""
""Goodness"", now, she was hotter than the barrel on fire
But I could use her for the job, so I told her to ride, ""C'mon""

""May I ask you what you headed to the West for?""
""I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you're down, you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
""Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you're with it""

""We out before the sun rise, gotta stallion for your partner to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine, down for whatever, let's ride, let's ride""
""These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive, we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the mornin' for details and hook-up""

You better count your money
Ghetto cowboy

""Rise and shine! Good mornin', howdy
Nine o'clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now, I done came a long way, and I don't wanna be late""
""Tell him I make ya  'cause you know we ain't""
""Move out! Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup""

You better count your money
Ghetto cowboy

I'm peepin' Krayzie's wanted poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble around here pretty soon
Glance across the room, I see this youngster getting ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie just might take his life

So, I approach him, and I pause ""Look, man, I really don't wanna brawl
But won't you chill before them laws come messin' up this master plan?""
Since he already rowdy, I just asked the man, ""Hey, you want some work?
Well, partner, put in your bid, and by the way, now what's your name?""
""They call me Layzie the Kid""

""The name's Powder P, can I get a twelve gauge?
Outlaw, everyday on the front page Mister Kid
If you give me the lowdown, me and Black Jack
Be ready for the showdown with two double-barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together I'm purty clever""
""So saddle up, jump on the bandwagon, because it's all goin' down""
I heard a guy run in the bar screamin', ""Krayzie's in town""

""Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside, and don't be stealin' nobody's damn horses""
Step inside the bar, ""Lay the Kid, you son of a gun""
""Hey, man, I'm glad you made it safely, now let's go have some fun
And this my partner Powder, he's a young gun""

""Howdy""
""Mighty glad to meet ya, son, oh yeah
You know I also brought a friend along
Meet Thug Queen, the horse peddler, straggler, just met her""
""Howdy, partner, already got the horses saddled up""
""I hope you good at robbin' banks like you rustle that cattle up""

""Now, y'all, it's gon' be gettin' dark real soon""
""I think you're right, I say we move, c'mon, let's move out

With a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin, and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me 'bout Jacuzzi, sounded interesting, so we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
Please leave a message after the tone

I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?

I'd say 'hey girl, come on right around'
So she knocked at the door, I was standing
With the keys in my hand to the 4x4, jumped in my ride
Checking that nobody saw
The club we went in, we got down bounce, bounce to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning, thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold

I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools

Saying why can't you keep your promises no more?
Saying you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in?
Wearing a jacket whose property? Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in?

Watching your every move
Think some day they might approve? Baby

(Ooh)
Guess who's back, back, back? 
Back again, gain, gain
Shady's back, back, back
Tell a friend

Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, la, la, la

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be 
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you Debbie.""

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me 

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me 

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves 
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it 

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

""Testing, attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me? 

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me 

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me

Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever
from the neck - see ain't nuttin changed, hit the stage
Set a date sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin hair with stylin gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit fuck, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for dem niggaz workin at the airport
who got laid off, I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole, whole, world, world

Ride dat bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin my stone, gatherin no moss
Mami I'm comin I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on fourth fourth
Make that track a fourth fouth
Rap, roll, utterly rocked

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet Pepto-Bismal

is the Republicans or Democratic candidate
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to you can dub it to your hit list
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing God's willing all things that are do able
The only liable limitation is to self

He didn't pour me a beer

Droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate

Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff

And he poured a glass
Then I smiled and said,
""I'll have some of that.""

Like old friends
Saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed.""
He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me,
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new t-shirt saying ""I'm a grandpa""
And being right there as our time got small
And holdin' her hand when the good Lord called her up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff

He said, ""When you get home she'll start to cry,
When she says, 'I'm sorry,' say 'So am I'

"Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm not a real political man

The difference in Iraq and Iran

Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

You can be anything in the world, in God we trust, 
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothin' comes easy it takes much practice,
Like I met a woman who was becoming a star, 
She was very beautiful leaving people in awe.
Singin' songs, later on, but the younger version,
Hung wit' the wrong person, got her stunger than heroine,
Cocaine, sniffin' up drugs all in her nose,
Could've died so young, now looks ugly and old,
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold thier breath 
Cuz she smells of corrosion and death,
Watch the company you keep, and the crowd you bring, 
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing,
So if you gonna be the best im'a tell you how,
Put your hands in the air and take the vow

B, b, boys and girls listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten.
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the clubs with fake ID.
Careful 'fore you meet a man with HIV.
You can host a TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be 
Rapists so act your age, don't pretend to be 
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow, 
You're thinking he can give you wealth but so 
Young boy, you could use a lot of help you know
Ya thinkin' life's all about smokin' weed and ice.
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write,
Beggin' different women for a place to sleep at night.
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish.
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)

 (I'll be where I wanna be)

B, be'fore we came to this country,
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys.
There was empires in Africa called Kush,
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans,
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold; When 
gold was converted to money it all changed,
Money then became empowerment for Europeans.
The Persian military invaded,
They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked,
Slavery was money, so they began making slaveships.
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was in shock that in the mountains were black faces.
Shot off their nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today you see.
If the truth is told the youth can grow.
They'll learn to survive, until they gain control.
Nobody says you have to be gangsters, hoes.
Read more, learn more, change the globe.
Ghetto children do your thing.
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king.
Young princess when you get your wedding ring,
Your man is saying, ""She's my queen!""

Aww, It was 1970-something

It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
Dad broke down and finally shaved 
Them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubix cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke 
In them cut off jeans
A Space Shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Aww, It was 1980-something

Now I got a mortgage and an SUV
But all this responsibility
Makes me wish sometimes
Sometimes....

It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin' back now I can see me

"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing

To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(Chorus from Aerosmith's Dream On)
(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B

It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing that shit!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus

But music is reflection of self, we just explain it
And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted

That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs

Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes

That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away","['8 mile', 'american', 'boom bap', 'comedy rap', 'detroit hip-hop', 'hardcore hip hop', 'hip hop', 'hip-hop', 'hiphop', 'horrorcore', 'midwest hip-hop', 'pop and chart', 'pop rap', 'rap', 'rapper', 'turkish', 'us', 'v']",89,2003,Sing For The Moment,Eminem,black,0,0,0,"(0, 0, 0)","rgb(19, 0, 0)",3CpoeW0cZSDzIRv5z34F87

Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy who told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga grippin' my balls 
Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin' they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin', off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops

Your homey Hove in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yes-sir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But like, fifty-two cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin'
with a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

If you feelin' like a pimp nigga', go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

Your boy back in the building, Brooklyn we back on the map
Me and my beautiful Bey-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest that run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, nigga's scared of that black
I drop that +Black, Album+ then I back, out it
As the best rapper alive nigga akse about me
From Bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammys
The O's to opposite, Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler homie
You a customer, crony
Got some, dirt on my shoulder, could you brush it off for me?

Kanye West:
Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Then I spent four-hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

Kanye West:
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it

"She was drivin' last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy 
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low 
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinnin'
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder 
When she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
But for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me

"I'm through with standing in line to clubs I'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be

(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

(Mmm so what you need)

I'll need a, a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

(Been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

(So how ya gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there

Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
And we'll, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free

(I'll have the quesadilla, on the house)

I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me

(So how ya gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's ""Who's Who""
They'll get you anything, with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial
Well, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars

You know nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard, 
I tried hard...but I guess I
gotta try harder.

I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First, let me explain that I'm just a black man, 
And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man, 
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet 
Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at 
But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me 
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see, 
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream, 
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me, 
Goin crazyyyy, (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it, 
But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater, 
And I been in so many collisions by puttin shit off till later. 

I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

It's like I'm takin five steps forward, and ten steps back 
Tryin' get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track 
And I keep runnin away the ones that say they love me the most 
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close? And uh, 
I just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and 
It's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and 
Lord, would you help me? And stop this pain 
I keep inflinctin on my family (family) 
Hustlin and gamblin, drinkin' and scramblin' 
And losin sight of what I supposed to be handlin' 
It's hard to manage cause every days a challenge and man 
And I'm slippin can't lose my balance and tryin not to panic 

I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...

but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

I see thangs won't change
I'm stuck in the game
as soon as I get out it 
keeps pullin me back mayne
got me doin' dirty dirt
so used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand no 9 to 5 work
studied on the streets, hustlers know what I mean 
hustlers ballin in force I'm tryin' make that major league
so we never leave never, til' the sun came up
gotta get it nope no leavin no rush 
today games they play gotta go hard to get what u put in
if you fall off then it's all on you
gotta watch what you sign to try so hard but I won't play the fool

i try so hard

"When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

He said, ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade""

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city 
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling
She's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall
The bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

And while that sends you reeling
From decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
And let's shout out loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me
'Cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part

I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here because it's who we are

I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part

Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away...
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away, like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide, I'm from a windy city
Like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fucking reason.
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces. (My life!)
Cause that's Jesus people, and Game he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Sigel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle (My life!)
I need some meditation, so I can lead my people

Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?

We are not the same, I am a Martian.
So approach my Phantom doors with caution.
You see them 24's spinnin'
I earned 'em.
I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music, and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson 'cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn I know his mama proud
And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like MJB, no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it outta town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty, like a glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds

The Game
Walked through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on
Me and the devil sharing chronic blunts
Listening to The Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, and my Sox hat
I'm Paid in Full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

You make me want to run 'til I find you

Had any more to give

Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

I find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space

I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur
They're all the same

Had any more to give

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me out
We shall overcome
It's all left still to play

We should have had the sun
Could have been inside
Instead we're over here

Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time too long defending
You and I are done pretending

Had any more to give

We'll walk this road together (Now some of you) through the storm
Whatever weather (Might still be in that place) cold or warm (If you're tryin to get out)
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone (Just follow me)
Holla if you feel like (I'll get you there) you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me

So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger

And drop dead, no more beef flingers

To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up

And my car look unapproachable
Super clean but its super mean

She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed
Count stacks, get fly, take trips and that's that
Real rap, I let her get high as she want and she feel that

So misunderstood, but what’s a World without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ’cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin’ family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature

It’s all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who’s buying, I’m a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money running shit and you niggas just runner-ups

Okay, I lost my mind, it’s somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don’t understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon’ be hoes, so I couldn’t blame Tammy

Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
Swear man, I be seeing through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end

Talking to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that’s adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt

Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these muthafuckas talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I’ll spill ya

Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I’ma ball ’til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do

If these niggas animals, then I’ma have a mink soon
Tell ‘em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on

Satisfied with nothing, you don’t know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G’s move in silence like lasagna
People say I’m borderline crazy, sorta kinda

Woman of my dreams, I don’t sleep so I can’t find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell ‘em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Don’t wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that’s tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me

Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha

bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I’m bald like Cuba
and I keep a killer ho, she gon’ blow right through ya
I be macking, ’bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler

Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas, so many times
that I keep these bucks steady on my mind
tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause

to feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
keep throwing my sign in the middle
hit ‘em up, piece on my side, ’cause ain’t no peace on my side, bitch

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubt's startin' to creep in, every day is just so gray and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's whack
But they don't know what dope is, and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue

You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure, no more I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me, when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dyin' I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause

They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now

Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I’m on my way


Let's go...
Yeah
You’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials

Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack

I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to Earth

I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed

Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

Ooooh

But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh


Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never tipped cause we needed the change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying

I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed

Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man!

I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just have to keep screaming until they hear you out


Oh

A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh

They're about to let you go
And the locker slam
On the plan you had tonight

You've been messing around
With a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know
Could put you right

In the lot, the boy that's idling by
Doesn't rev your heart
Cause it's only lonely spots
He shares with you

And the long halls
And the gray walls
Are gonna split apart

Memories that you won't remember

So you got a little education
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school
Maybe some of it'll rub off on you

The boys are busy in the mirrors
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
More memories you won't remember

I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Verse One: Ma$e

Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face Boo, not behind your back
Niggaz talk shit, we never mind that
Funny, never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit, and make a nigga say, 'Rewind that'
Niggaz know, we go against the Harlem Jigalo
Getcha hoe, lick her low, make the bitch, hit the do'
I represent honies with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says, 'OK, my tint smoke gray'
No way, nigga leave without handin me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my 6
Niggaz outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship (uhh, uhh)

Or I drive Mercedes (uhh, uhh)
Bay-bee bay-BEE!

Verse Two: Puff Daddy

I was in one bedroom, dreamin of a million (yeah)
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling (that's right)
I was a gentleman, livin in tenements
Now I'm swimmin in, all the women that be tens (hoo)
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins (uh-huh)
Hoes of all complexions, I like cinnamon
Ma$e you got some hoes well nigga, send em in (c'mon)
What you waitin for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Ma$e: Nah Puff, that's a Benz)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way
it's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous, how you put your lips on this

And I be switchin fees with a wrist full of G's
Nigga please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

Chorus

Verse Three: Puff Daddy, Ma$e

Now Puff rule the world, even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies come (yeah)
Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggaz wouldn't dare put they faces (c'mon)

Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my third dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the mami chochi and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar (yeah)
And everywhere I drive I'm a star, little kids
all on the corner scream, 'That's my car!'

It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I.
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I. (uh-huh)

All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, opposites attract but
We one and the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play witchu, I wanna lay witchu,
Stay witchu,pray witchu, grow old and gray witchu,
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
'Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
'Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
'Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me

Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you

I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

I'm that light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare In the moment of despair,
I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do

Hope, I just need a ray of that

All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue

You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure, no more I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me, when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dyin' I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause

They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets, and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots

"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Faleena would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Faleena
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Faleena, the girl that I loved

So in anger I
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride

Just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

And at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for
Faleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Faleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Faleena, goodbye","['american', 'death by heart surgery']",15,1960,El Paso,Marty Robbins,white,0,0,1,"(255, 255, 255)","rgb(252, 242, 246)",4f8hBeMXMvssn6HtFAtblo

"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,
I shoved it on down into overdrive.

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin',
And down in the dips she started to rockin'.
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!""",['country'],69,1972,Hot Rod Lincoln,Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen,white,0,0,1,"(255, 255, 255)","rgb(250, 255, 255)",2sZjmnS1BSoc1svOu5P8LM

Look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy

'cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear. 
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge,
both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid,
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it,
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.

Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin',
jig around, shakin' ya rump,
and when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
tell him step off, I'm doin' the Hump.

Grab my Mickey and my buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, brothers strikin' through to be seen
A Lexus 400 to the triple gold Z's
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin kinda funky
A sick honkey, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Layin' in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the Telly, I gotta get some ""nuca""

Aw naw, could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad wanna do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her, so I called TL
Smooth me up, Sally wanted new dick
And Monty licked, so try an' make it real quick

Aw yeah, I jumped in the F-train
But wait a minute, we gotta hit the store, man
I got to get some gum and some Tic-Tac's
Two tall cans and a packet of Blackjacks
We got the goods, now we're headed for the hoe down
There goes the Telly, so fella, won't you slow down?
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case we gotta bust a quick one
Locked and loaded, let's go look for, like, one-eighteen
But lay low cause I really don't wanna be seen
""Is this the room?""
Aw yeah, that's the right one
I got the black broad and you got the white one
So hit the light, man, I just might, man
Try an' throw this thing all night an'
Get her so sprung, that she'll drop some ""mail""

But sometimes my people be actin like they evil

And only down ass niggaz can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low

Warren G. was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some phones

On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.

So I hooks a left on 2-1 and Lewis

I jumped out the ride, and said ""What's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""

Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won't 'cha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said ""Damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town

Let me contemplate
I glance in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin'
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G.

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G. Child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""Ooh, I like your size""
She said ""My car's broke down and you sing real nice,
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

I'm tweaking
Into a whole new era

Step to this, I dare ya

Strings

"Intro: Notorious B.I.G.

One, one two
Check me out right here ya'll

Verse One: Puff Daddy

Yo, the sun don't shine forever
(BIG: You can turn the track up a little bit for me)
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
(BIG: All up in my ears)
Better now than never, business before pleasure
(BIG: The mic is loud, but the beats isn't loud)
P-Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
(BIG: YEAH!)
So when you hear somethin, make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin
(BIG: YEAH! Now the mic is lower, turn the mics up)
Our music keeps you movin, what are you provin?
(BIG: Turn that shit all the way up, yeah)
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
(BIG: Music's gettin louder)
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby
(BIG: This shit is hot!)
Talkin crazy ain't gonna get you nuthin but choked
(BIG: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And BIG you know you too hard for these cats
I'm a wing cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin up facts (uhh) you rakin up plats

Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.

In a Commision, dont  ask for permission to hit em
He don't like me, him and wild wifey was wit em
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of ... (Satan) ... they say my killin's too blatant
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin
Duct tapin, your fam destiny
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal
Gun rest under the vest by the abdominal
hum a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The mo shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic
Parked in quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Underboss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank White

Chorus: Busta Rhymes

We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggaz is at? (2X)
Where the fuck my bitches at?
Where my bitches is at?
(repeat all 2X)

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

Verse Four: Notorious B.I.G.

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heatas n the two-seaters, with two midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the kids, Peniro, sheek loops
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him
Niggaz step up, we just macin them
placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy
Business rise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition
Nother day in the life of the Comission

Chorus 2X w/ Puff talking
Aiyyo, can you hear me out
there?
Aiyyo turn me up, nobody
can hear me out there
That's good, it's all fucked
up now
Y'all know it's all fucked
up now right?
What the fuck y'all gonna
do now?
What I'ma do now?
Can y'all hear me out there?

Miami the base and the sunset glow
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill
Me an Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like (Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'

But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'ma scoot me somethin hot
In this south-sea merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas, with the hot mommies
Screamin (Ay pappi)
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your door
We flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go

An we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on southbeach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, evr'ybody got em

See first of all, I know these so called players wouldn't tell you this
But, Ima be real and say what's on my heart
Lets take this chance to make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start yeah eah eah yeeah

Then I think about, all the years we put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this faar
Then I think about,where would I be if we were to just fall apart
And I can't stand the thought of losing youu. uh oh

Meet me at the alter in your white dress
We ain't get no younger we might as well do 
Been feelin' you all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married I just want to get married

Meet me at the alter in your white dress
We ain't gettin no younger (so) we might as well do it
Been feelin' you all the while girl and I must confess
Lets get married

Said I done it all, but frankly girl I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
Cause making love to just anyone ain't happinin'
I just gotta be with you.ooh osh
Did you think about, us finishing something we started so long ago
I wanna give you my aauhall (all)
Did you think about maybe us havin some babies
Come on wont you be my lady
Forever girllllllllllll

Im ready to, commit to you

I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here.

Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor, like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass, worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Ahh)

It's the return of the, oh wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say, what I think he did, did he
And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Haha)

Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you know what
Flippin' to you know who, yeah but he's so cute though

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents bedrooms (Eh-eh-eh)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose

My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit 4th grade, they got the Discovery Channel, don't they
We ain't nothing but mammals, well some of us are cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (Eww)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps, to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe"".

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Ahh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim  Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim  Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all 
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it at all

I just get on the mic and spit it 
And whether you like to admit it, (Rip) I just shit it 
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny

'Cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person, in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' ""I don't give a fuck.""
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time loud as you can, how does it go

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

"I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She'd phone, say 'hey boy, come on right around'
So I knock at the door, you were standing
With a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin, and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me 'bout Jacuzzi, sounded interesting, so we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
Please leave a message after the tone

I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?
Calls diverted to answerphone, red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in?

Whenever the coast was clear, and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say 'hey girl, come on right around'
So she knocked at the door, I was standing
With the keys in my hand to the 4x4, jumped in my ride
Checking that nobody saw
The club we went in, we got down bounce, bounce to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning, thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold

I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why can't you keep your promises no more?
Saying you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in?
Wearing a jacket whose property? Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in?

All they seem to do, is be checking up on you, baby
Watching your every move
Think some day they might approve? Baby

Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?

You wanna die it's not my turn (""just like music"")
To do somethin to me like jump in the Mercedes
On the highway, doin over eighty
Without music baby.. (""Oww! I'll go crazy.. just like music"")
Make me call my homey on the phone
Like there's somethin new out, that got me in the zone

I wish music can adopt me (""just like music"")

Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music

Got me in the ear, sayin sweet nothings
Make love come out the mouth, no frontin
Like all of a sudden, (""just like music"")
Takin away your worries and cares
Any problems, music'll be right there
Together match yo, we a perfect pair
Is that true Marvin?  (""Yeahhhhh!  Music"")
Yo, to get you to bang this
Body soul-snatcher, universal language

No confrontation, parlay all night
It's just the sensation (""just like music"")

Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a, happy day
Music makes a, cloud flow by baby
Your music is my tears in-side my eyes (just like music)
Your music makes me want to sing

Music is my heart and soul, more precious than gold

See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be 
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you Debbie.""

Now this looks a job for me

'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me 

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me 

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves 
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it 

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

""Testing, attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me? 

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me 

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy

Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me

'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date
Your momma's all worried when you get home late
Droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shakin so much
And it's the way that she looks with rice in her hair
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk 
And he poured a glass
Then I smiled and said,
""I'll have some of that.""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends
Saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed.""
He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me,
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new t-shirt saying ""I'm a grandpa""
And being right there as our time got small
And holdin' her hand when the good Lord called her up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff

He said, ""When you get home she'll start to cry,
When she says, 'I'm sorry,' say 'So am I'
Then look into those eyes so deep in love
And drink it up

"It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, til' the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgoten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thickpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and 
I would press that clutch 
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain

When Daddy let me drive

Daddy let me drive

Oh he let me drive

Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm not a real political man

Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

You get back what you put out
Even if you take the good route
Can't count the hood out

Just keep it real with the ones came in with

Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'?

She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

By the county line the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinkin'?

Out the other side she was hollerin' faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right

I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-slidin' like bo duke
What was I thinkin'?

I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin', oh what was I thinkin'

Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... 'cause I was

"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing

To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(Chorus from Aerosmith's Dream On)
(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B

It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing that shit!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus

But music is reflection of self, we just explain it
And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted

That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs

Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes

That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on!)

The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis

Yelling at an old lady,

Butt squeezin', it's the season

We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all
You know what I'm talkin 'bout right? Look

I'm never going nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me
Respected highly, HIIII MR. O'REILLY
Hope all is well, kiss the plantiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of my Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee

Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell them holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later until these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars

Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm

And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jeena-fah Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz

Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

"She was drivin' last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy 
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low 
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinnin'
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder 
When she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
But for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on

Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these muthafuckas talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I’ll spill ya

Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I’ma ball ’til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do

If these niggas animals, then I’ma have a mink soon
Tell ‘em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y’all don’t get the picture ‘less the flash is on

Satisfied with nothing, you don’t know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G’s move in silence like lasagna
People say I’m borderline crazy, sorta kinda

Woman of my dreams, I don’t sleep so I can’t find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell ‘em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell


Word to my mama, I’m out of my lima bean
Don’t wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that’s tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me

Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
disturb me, and you’ll be all over the flow like Luda
bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I’m bald like Cuba
and I keep a killer ho, she gon’ blow right through ya
I be macking, ’bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler

Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas, so many times
that I keep these bucks steady on my mind
tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause

to feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
keep throwing my sign in the middle
hit ‘em up, piece on my side, ’cause ain’t no peace on my side, bitch

Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I out on bond I might be facin' 8's
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubt's startin' to creep in, every day is just so gray and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's whack
But they don't know what dope is, and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick you

Gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothin' else I can do, 'cause

You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure, no more I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me, when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more

But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though

They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets, and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots

And the crackers' ass, little Cracker Jack beat makin'

Return of the Mack, get up
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit

We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, Sweater Gang
Nope, nope, y'all can't copy

Yup, bad, moonwalkin', this here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway and we did it our way
Grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, I'm a I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four track, busing halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat crushin', labels out here

Nah they can't tell me nothing, we give that to the people
Spread it across the country, labels out here
Nah they can't tell me nothing, we give it to the people
Spread it across the country

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you

Y'all can't stop me
I go hard like I've got an 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat
Like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week

(Raw! Time to go off. Gone)? Deuces, goodbye
I've got a world to see;
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes
So I'm giving it back to the people now
Sing that song and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us

Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I’m illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking bucking them out here
I’m lookin fuckin fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, There’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really want the Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer

Slap her booty with my palms
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls

Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?

"I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie
But there I was
I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high by the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long ones, tall ones, short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said...

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl

I thought to myself, what could that mean?
Am I going crazy, or is this just a dream?
Now wait a minute...
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one, more time

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl

That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
and murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems

Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve""

Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen

of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free

To cheat ourselves at solitaire

And a big brown Mercedes sedan 
What I think this girl, 
She really wants is to be in love with a man 
 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
But without love it ain't much 

She saw him standing in the section marked 
If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie 
She threw him bread and said make me scream 
In the dark what could he say 

Boys with small talk and small minds 
Really don't impress me in bed 
She said I need a man's man baby 
Diamonds and furs 
Love would only conquer my head 

She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
But without love it ain't much 

They made haste in the brown sedan 
They drove to 55 Secret street 
They made love and by the seventh wave 
She knew she had a problem 
She thought real love is real scary 
Money only pays the rent 
Love is forever that's all your life 
Love is heaven sent it's glamorous 

Lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
But without love it ain't much","['funk', 'percussion', 'pop']",30,1984,The Glamorous Life,Sheila E.,brown,0,0.745,0.647,"(165, 42, 42)","rgb(154, 59, 28)",179SfVFJ0ZN41toTxnpgRD
"Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house, though I know you're not home

But I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I see you walkin' real slow, and smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

Out on the road today, I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said, ""don't look back, you can never look back""
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go, but

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun

"(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
(On your loving)

Verse 1
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way

CHORUS:
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)

Verse 2
Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you, then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangsta talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty , you're ready for lovin'
You're real independent so your parents be buggin'
But if you ever need a place to stay,
(Oooh you love me) come around my way

CHORUS:
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
To the bridge
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)

Verse 3
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With that New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way, you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watchin' all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawkin' you
Baby-hair pumping, lip gloss is shinin'
I think you in the mood for winin' and dinin'
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renée, I love you (smooch)
You're from around the way

CHORUS
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl
That's the one for me

but along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
and showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
one for life the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside

Ron had enough of being broke every day
saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So Ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
because he chose to walk on the wildside

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job a good life. A good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupt and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated cause their skin was brown
Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
but soon as the case started moving slow
what do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill carol collect a big check
Blame it on a black man. What the heck!
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
so he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside!

Came to the city. Place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
and the girls play hopscotch

Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
and a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died

Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
Well, don't hesitate,
'Cause your love just won't wait

Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day

With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine
I can see them under the pine

"I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Remmy
I didn't mind it when he fucked me from behind
It felt fine 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the jeep
Told him ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, hoe hop
Raw top in my mans drop
Then this homey Jimmy, he's screamin' ""Gimme,""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Cold suckin' his dick, rockin' the mike
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that could have made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy

I don't want dick tonight, eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush and Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't cap
I used to see him, in the tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I aint frontin'
The sex was whack, a four stroke creep
I jumped on his dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
I'll pass, nigga the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double blast
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your five G stones
I'll give you ten Gs nigga if you leave me alone, screamin'

I don't want dick tonight, eat my pussy right

The moral of the story is this
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, and big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I can be blunt'
I treat it like it's precious, I aint gonna front
For limp dick niggas, that's frontin' like they really
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

Close your eyes as you ride, right out your socks

Wanna gimme the cash he made off his last bundle

Don't deep throat the C-note she float
Murder she wrote, and keeps the heat close

With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips,
She's so right I'm gon' beat

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves although with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say shit""

See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

I wanna be free, I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac, That is my shit
And I throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C A D I L L A C bitch (biatch)
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint wet drippin shorty like my 24’s (umbrella)
I don't got 24’s (no oh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

Hollis
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Macklemore
Man I’m lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I’m illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking bucking them out here
I’m lookin fuckin fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, There’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really want the Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I'm dreaming of, as I bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming

Hollis
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

ScHoolboy Q
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
I had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin’, my uncle was on
14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone
Sendin’ portions of his liquor, water in the Patrón
Rather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it and the vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns on ‘em
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, kill the fuckin wimps
See what’s poppin’ at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ awe...some
swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Girl does she want it low?
This shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slide till the gas is finished, Q

You say it's too late to make it but is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down

You got to give in, so I'll be good

Home by the fire where a man can just relax
Sippers there by the chair, not a worry, not a care

Played a little poker the time had passed me by
Shoes in my hand and my darlin' wife in bed
Up the stairs sayin' a prayer
Then a voice comes through the air

Tell me a story, tell me a story

That's was bigger than a whale

Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you,
Take me away from here and be my man.""

"Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze

Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
Seems I had to fight my whole life through

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame

But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man that give me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew

At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty, mangey dog that named me Sue

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said
""My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!""
Yeah!  That's what I told him

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear

I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile

Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah!  He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and ya got the right
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do

But you oughta thank me before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""
Yeah, what could I do?  What could I do?

I got all choked up and threw down my gun
Called him my Pa and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view

"On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed

And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name

"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,
I shoved it on down into overdrive.

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin',
And down in the dips she started to rockin'.
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'

Light up all the fires in me

Hungry to touch
I'm eager to please 
Out of control
And I hand you the keys

When we make love
It's a passionate thing 
You shudder and shake
Sink your teeth in my skin 
I almost believe you were made
To be played by my hands

And you got the power
It amazes me still 
How you play my emotions
With consummate skill 
I don't have to look any further
Than into your eyes

So don't try to tell me

It goes way deeper than that

I can't believe it's just so round
It's like out there

I'm hooked and I can't stop staring

Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha

Ooh, rump of smooth skin

Well use me, use me, 'cause you ain't that average groupie

I've seen them dancin'

Red beans and rice didn't miss her

I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me

If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys
Playin with our toys

Under the sun, under the sun
So rough, so tough when I get down

I wants to get fucked up when I'm chillin', whoa
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill-in
You let her funk me 'cause my funk is the best
Comin from the west
Kickin that shit be occupied, dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
Hittin them dips, cd skips but I'm straight
As I bounce, rock, skate, now I'll toast to that

"I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living
She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round, and she goes down on me

And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take

Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again, and then I bumped again
I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress

One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now

Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye

I dedicate this record, the carnival to all you brothers takin' long
Trips down south, virginia, baltimore, all around the world, and your
Girl gets this message that you ain't comin' back. she's sittin' back
In the room, the lights are off, she's cryin', and then my voice comes in
Pow!, in the middle of the night, and this is what I told her for you

Chorus: (sung)

Every time I make a run, girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you got to understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til november
Said I'll be gone 'til november, yo I'll be gone 'til november
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til november
I'll be gone 'til november, I'll be gone 'til november
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til november
January, february, march, april, may
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til november, I'll be gone 'til november
And give a kiss to my mother

Verse 1: (sung)

When I come back, there'll be no need to clock
I'll have enough money to buy out blocks
Tell my brother, go to school in september
So he won't mess up in summer school in the summer
Tell my cousin, jerry, wear his condom
If you don't wear condom, you'll see a red lump
Woh oh oh oh
You sucker mc's, you got no flow
I heard your style, you're s-o s-o

Verse 2: (rap)

I had to flip nuttin' and turn it into somethin'
Hip-hop turns to the future rock when I smash a punk (bing!)
Commit treason, then I'll have a reason to hunt you down
It's only right, it's rappin' season
Yeah, you with the loud voice, posin' like you're top choice
Your voice, I'll make a hearse out of your rolls royce
Besides, I got my girl to remember
And I'll commit it that I'll be back in november

"I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She'd phone, say 'hey boy, come on right around'
So I knock at the door, you were standing
With a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin, and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me 'bout Jacuzzi, sounded interesting, so we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
Please leave a message after the tone

I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?
Calls diverted to answerphone, red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in?

Whenever the coast was clear, and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say 'hey girl, come on right around'
So she knocked at the door, I was standing
With the keys in my hand to the 4x4, jumped in my ride
Checking that nobody saw
The club we went in, we got down bounce, bounce to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning, thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold

I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why can't you keep your promises no more?
Saying you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in?
Wearing a jacket whose property? Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in?

All they seem to do, is be checking up on you, baby
Watching your every move
Think some day they might approve? Baby

Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?

"It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, til' the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgoten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thickpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and 
I would press that clutch 
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain

When Daddy let me drive

Daddy let me drive

Oh he let me drive

The best one yet

Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran

Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

"I was raised off of rural route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
And race barefoot back to Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned the corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road.

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road.

Her daddy didn't like me much
In my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
And drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road.

I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
It feels like I found a long lost friend

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth

Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

The Game:
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain

The Game:
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know ""What's Going On"" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?
I love you ma

50 Cent
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop

"Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

It's hard to say it

Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh

I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

She's showing off

Driving too fast

Does it ever drive you crazy

Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change

He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

Moving too fast

É ela a menina que vem e que passa
num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado é mais que um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

Ah, por que estou tão sózinho?
Ah, por que tudo é tão triste?
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que quando ela passa
O mundo sorrindo se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo por causa do amor

Swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes,
Each one she passes goes ""ah!""

How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at him

This here's a jam for all the fellas
Try to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down 'cause you're overzealous
Play hard to get, females get jealous

OK smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter

Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants

A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'
Says she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move

(Oh, huh, yeah, huh, oh huh, yeah, huh)
Just bust a move
(Huh yeah, huh yeah, uh huh yeah huh)

You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces

From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope

New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row

She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello,
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move

(If you want it, you got it)
(If you want it, baby, you got it) Just bust a move
(If you want it, you got it)
(If you want it, baby, you got it)

In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way.""

Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are

Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man

So on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

(If you want it, you got it)
(If you want it, baby, you got it) Just bust a move

In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can

And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting

So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now you're feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked

Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove

In the Hollywood hills and the boulevards
Her parents threw big parties
Everyone was there
They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger and
Sonny and Cher

She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage I can tell that she can't let go and she can't
Relax
And just before she hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby
I sing:

Everything's gonna be all right
Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye
Everything's gonna be all right

Down that street about a half a mile
And all her friends tell her she's so pretty

'Cause even her smile looks like a frown
She's seen her share of devils in this angel town

Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey.

Katy Perry
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo
Oh oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast

Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (ah)

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach

I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything

Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

"To this day, when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip-flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun
'I'm On Fire' and 'Born To Run'
You looked at me and I was done
And we, we're just gettin' started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Sang 'Ooh, ooh'

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you sayin', ""Don't go""

When I think about you, I think about seventeen
I think about my old Jeep, I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night, Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet
There'd still be a spark

From back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
'Bout your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear 'Born In The U.S.A'
Do you relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about seventeen?
Do you think about my old Jeep? Think about the stars in the sky?

If he would have played it just one more time

But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove

Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said: ""Boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due

Johnny, rosin' up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case and he said: ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
Then he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

Verse 1
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way

CHORUS:
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)

Verse 2
Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you, then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangsta talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty , you're ready for lovin'
You're real independent so your parents be buggin'
But if you ever need a place to stay,
(Oooh you love me) come around my way

CHORUS:
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
To the bridge
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)

Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With that New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way, you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watchin' all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawkin' you
Baby-hair pumping, lip gloss is shinin'
I think you in the mood for winin' and dinin'
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renée, I love you (smooch)

Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks and no girl was sweeter
Come prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellaxsdlkjfklsdjlkjdlkjflkdsjflsdkjflsdjljkfdlousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
but along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
and showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
one for life the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside 

Do, do, do, dobido, do, do, do, dobido, 
do, do, do, dobido, do, do, do, dobidodoooooooooo 

Ron had enough of being broke every day
saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So Ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
because he chose to walk on the wildside 

Do, do, do, dobido, do, do, do, dobido, 
do, do, do, dobido, do, do, do, dobidodoooooooooo 

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job a good life. A good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupt and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated cause their skin was brown
Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
but soon as the case started moving slow
what do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill carol collect a big check
Blame it on a black man. What the heck!
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
so he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside! 

Do, do, do, dobido, do, do, do, dobido,

Little Tiffany. Only thirteen
Came to the city. Place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
and the girls play hopscotch
So far her vacation was top notch
But of the blue a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
and a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died
Innocently on the wildside

"V-Town, brother, check it out, I'm 'bout to throw down
Dick in hand, the shit that had you toked down
A little city, chillin' in the North Bay
Needless to say, my boyz don't play, fool
Yorker sidin', you know how the songs goes
In the back, sippin' purple chongos
Don't look for trouble, but it always seems to find us
Forty-grippin', panties, sippin', and these finks are right behind us
Quick left, one blow, K.O.
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh, what the hell, I guess I better tell ya
It's Friday night, I got a brand new kit on
A fifth of Henny, for me to get bent on
Hit the country club to pick up ML
Eighty West, back to the hotel

At the Telly, Bones is doing pipe work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The Latina on the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me, babydoll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night, so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, brothers strikin' through to be seen
A Lexus 400 to the triple gold Z's
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin kinda funky
A sick honkey, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Layin' in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the Telly, I gotta get some ""nuca""

Aw naw, could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad wanna do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her, so I called TL
Smooth me up, Sally wanted new dick
And Monty licked, so try an' make it real quick

Aw yeah, I jumped in the F-train
But wait a minute, we gotta hit the store, man
I got to get some gum and some Tic-Tac's
Two tall cans and a packet of Blackjacks
We got the goods, now we're headed for the hoe down
There goes the Telly, so fella, won't you slow down?
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case we gotta bust a quick one
Locked and loaded, let's go look for, like, one-eighteen
But lay low cause I really don't wanna be seen
""Is this the room?""
Aw yeah, that's the right one
I got the black broad and you got the white one
So hit the light, man, I just might, man
Try an' throw this thing all night an'
Get her so sprung, that she'll drop some ""mail""

"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it right outside the window

There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me

When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me

And if you whisper like that

If you want me like this
And if you need me like that

And it's all coming back to me

But it's all coming back to me now

But it's all coming back

And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me

If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that

"I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living
She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round, and she goes down on me

And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take

Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again, and then I bumped again
I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress

One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now

Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there

Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar (yeah)
And everywhere I drive I'm a star, little kids

"I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living
She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round, and she goes down on me

And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take

Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again, and then I bumped again
I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress

One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now

Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
In the place we used to start

"You better count your money
Ghetto cowboy

The name is Krayzie ""Big Bad Ass"" Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole, along
With some cash, even took the mayor's daughter

Now, that there's kidnappin', but she was with it so I brought her
Then, got myself into a whole heap of trouble, double-crossed by the law
So there's nobody to run to, yeah, it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun
Outlaw--call him Leather Face

I'm headed for the West, heard they got
A couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well, uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown

So, I continue my mission it's gettin' dark
So I'm watchin' for them damn Injuns
They like to catch ya, then they rob and split
I be a rootin'-tootin'-shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips

All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse""Whoa, Nellie! Who in the bushes?
You better speak out or I'm a let my shotgun song sing out""
Who is this? I hope this ain't the law
Jump out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun

""C'mon out, right now, I'm gettin' angry""
Took a step back, 'cause it could get dangerous
Thug Queen, ""the horse stealer""
""Please don't shoot it's just me, Thug Queen, the horse-stealer""

""Then, why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes?""
""I'm wanted in four counties for armed robbery
Killed to two sheriffs, six of his best men with my hand, stole two horses
Thought you was the law, that's why I jumped in the bushes""
""Goodness"", now, she was hotter than the barrel on fire
But I could use her for the job, so I told her to ride, ""C'mon""

""May I ask you what you headed to the West for?""
""I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you're down, you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
""Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you're with it""

""We out before the sun rise, gotta stallion for your partner to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine, down for whatever, let's ride, let's ride""
""These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive, we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the mornin' for details and hook-up""

You better count your money
Ghetto cowboy

""Rise and shine! Good mornin', howdy
Nine o'clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now, I done came a long way, and I don't wanna be late""
""Tell him I make ya  'cause you know we ain't""
""Move out! Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup""

You better count your money
Ghetto cowboy

I'm peepin' Krayzie's wanted poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble around here pretty soon
Glance across the room, I see this youngster getting ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie just might take his life

So, I approach him, and I pause ""Look, man, I really don't wanna brawl
But won't you chill before them laws come messin' up this master plan?""
Since he already rowdy, I just asked the man, ""Hey, you want some work?
Well, partner, put in your bid, and by the way, now what's your name?""
""They call me Layzie the Kid""

""The name's Powder P, can I get a twelve gauge?
Outlaw, everyday on the front page Mister Kid
If you give me the lowdown, me and Black Jack
Be ready for the showdown with two double-barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together I'm purty clever""
""So saddle up, jump on the bandwagon, because it's all goin' down""
I heard a guy run in the bar screamin', ""Krayzie's in town""

""Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside, and don't be stealin' nobody's damn horses""
Step inside the bar, ""Lay the Kid, you son of a gun""
""Hey, man, I'm glad you made it safely, now let's go have some fun
And this my partner Powder, he's a young gun""

""Howdy""
""Mighty glad to meet ya, son, oh yeah
You know I also brought a friend along
Meet Thug Queen, the horse peddler, straggler, just met her""
""Howdy, partner, already got the horses saddled up""
""I hope you good at robbin' banks like you rustle that cattle up""

""Now, y'all, it's gon' be gettin' dark real soon""

As cute as can be, up in the clubs with fake ID.
Careful 'fore you meet a man with HIV.
You can host a TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be 
Rapists so act your age, don't pretend to be 
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow, 
You're thinking he can give you wealth but so 
Young boy, you could use a lot of help you know
Ya thinkin' life's all about smokin' weed and ice.
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write,
Beggin' different women for a place to sleep at night.
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish.
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be what I wanna be)
 (I know I can)
 (Be what I wanna be)
 (If I work hard at it)
 (I'll be where I wanna be)

B, be'fore we came to this country,
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys.
There was empires in Africa called Kush,
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans,
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold; When 
gold was converted to money it all changed,
Money then became empowerment for Europeans.
The Persian military invaded,
They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked,
Slavery was money, so they began making slaveships.
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was in shock that in the mountains were black faces.
Shot off their nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today you see.
If the truth is told the youth can grow.
They'll learn to survive, until they gain control.
Nobody says you have to be gangsters, hoes.
Read more, learn more, change the globe.
Ghetto children do your thing.
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king.
Young princess when you get your wedding ring,
Your man is saying, ""She's my queen!""

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be what I wanna be)
 (I know I can)
 (Be what I wanna be)

Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

The Game:
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

From the beginning to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

The Game:
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know ""What's Going On"" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?
I love you ma

"I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place 
I was looking for something I couldn't replace 
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known

And like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back

There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I left a million miles of memories on that road 
And every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known,

Terrified of the world

Raise those hands, this is our party

You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone, public excuse me

Been wanting my cake and eat it too, wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam

It was like winning a huge meet

But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it

Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from

No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders.)

Down yonder and stumbled upon Jeff VanVonderen

'Cause I needed an intervention in this
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very things that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it

Call me crazy, but I had this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you regular civilians
But until then drums get killed
I'm coming straight at MCs, blood get spilled

And I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped the villain and shit that say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children, but if one kid

Out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft

"Evryone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy; the folks just called him 'Yellow'
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day, while he was workin', the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky; there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! Ol' yellow's leavin'""
But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door

Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said, ""This one's for Becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say

""I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man""

Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants

Sits down next to you and starts talkin'

Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces

Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope

Could care less about the five you're blowin'

They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are

Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man

So on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen

And these are my plans
Hot tips for the boys
Fresh news from the force

When it's all mixed up
Better break it down

In the world of silence
In the world of sound

""No sleep for dreaming"" say the architects of life
Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice
They make no mention of the beauty of decay
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella save it for a rainy day
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground
(Break it down again)
I want to break it down
(Break it down again)

Horsin' around
Pray to power
Play to the crowd with your big hit sound
And they won't simmer, won't simmer, won't simmer down
Play to the crowd
Play to the crowd
Play yeah yeah

It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
Fast off to heaven just like Moses on a motorbike
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new to help you
With the ups and downs
(Break it down again)
I want to break it down
(Break it down again)
Break it down again
(Break it down again)
(Break it down again)
Here we go!

Break it down again

No more building up
It is time to dissolve

"In a hand painted night, me and Gypsy Scotty are partners
At the Hotel Flamingo, wearin' black market shoes
This loud Cuban band is crucifying John Lennon
No one wants to be lonely, no one wants to sing the blues

She's perched like a parrot on his tuxedo shoulder
Christ, what's she doing with him, she could be dancing with me
She stirs the ice in her glass with her elegant finger
I want to be what she's drinking, yeah, I just want to be

To move around in your heart

Gypsy Scotty is driving his big long yellow car
She flies like a bird over his shoulder
She whispers in his ear, boy, you are my star

But I saw you first, I'm the first one tonight
Yes, I saw you first, don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart

In the bone-colored dawn, me and Gypsy Scotty are singin'
The radio is playin', she left her shoes out in the back
He tells me a story about some girl he knows in Kentucky
He just made that story up, there ain't no girl like that

Sheddin' ya tears with me

Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old

Went from Lucy's and buses
To fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas
To Lexus to Rovers

And the lights are on and they want a show

Lupe Fiasco
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check two one two
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?
Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me
I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too

The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid
And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise 
They want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim

'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow 
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autographed picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me

Everybody ride her, just like a bus route

And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends

Can't never count me out, y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year (yeah) the South's champion (yeah)

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubt's startin' to creep in, every day is just so gray and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's whack
But they don't know what dope is, and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue

You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure, no more I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me, when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me

But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoked

Went through friends, some of 'em I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets, and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots

And the crackers' ass, little Cracker Jack beat makin'

"A long time ago when the earth was green,
and there was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen,
They'd run around free while the earth was being born,
But the loveliest of them all was the Unicorn.

There were green alligators and long necked geese,
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.

Now God seen some sinning and it gave Him pain,
And He says ""Stand back, I'm going to make it rain.""
He says ""Hey brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do,
Build me a floating zoo. And take some of them...

Green alligators and long necked geese,
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
Don't you forget My Unicorn.""

Old Noah was there to answer the call,
He finished up making the ark just as the rain started fallin.
He marched in the animals two by two,
And he called out as they went through, ""Hey Lord, I got your...""

Green alligators and long necked geese,
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord I'm so forlorn,
I just can't see no Unicorn.""

Then Noah looked out through the driving rain,
Them Unicorns were hiding, playing silly games.
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pouring,
Oh them silly Unicorns.

There were green alligators and long necked geese,
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees,
Noah cried ""Close the door, cause the rain is pouring,
And we just can't wait for no Unicorn.""

The ark started movin, it drifted with the tide.
Them Unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried,
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away,
And that's why you'll never seen a Unicorn... to this very day.

Where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her mama was working on a chain-gang
A mean, vicious woman

And pick her a mess o' polk salad 
And carry it home in a tote sack

Anything that it would tell me 
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's

Fly away with you

That he'll only break my heart again 
Should I decide to stay

To that land of gentle breezes

Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya 
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made 
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop
So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground 
Being lowdown
I do the showdown with any little ho' 'round (NO!)
I wanna know who you're believing
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheating
You said I know you're mister O.P.P man
You P.P man
Won't only see me man
You should've know that I ain't hitting the step
That I was with it a bit
Not to consider the rep (Heck!)
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty By Nature
Not cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark

You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

Hip Hop, Hip, Hip Hop, Hip, Hip Hop Hooray
There's many hungry Hip Hoppers
One reason Hip Hop's the top today
Swerve what you heard
Cause I ain't baling no hay
Ain't chopping no crop
But still growing every day

Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Ill town
Drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns
Beat downs are found
Don't know me! Don't come around!

Tippy tippy pause
Tippy tippy pause
Some start creepin' up, I eat 'em up
Their styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That's the way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty's purr 
Now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof 
My problem solver name is Mook
I'm hittin' woodies in a hoody
Peace to Jesette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Jenae and every hood Gee
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S & Quest, Nice & Smooth and Cypress Hill

And maintain to leave blood stains

But get popped like a pimple

So let me tell ya what I'm worth 
More than a stealth bomba 
I cause drama, the enforcer 
Music floats like a flying saucer 
Or a 747 jet, never forget 
I'm the brother that keeps the girls' panties wet 
The mic gets smoked 
Once you hear the beat kick 
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick 
So check the flavor that I'm bringin' 
The one and only D-R-E

Five for the host

To take of this business I need to attend to 
'Cause my rent's due
And the rap gang's my meal ticket 
So you goddamn right, I'm a kick it 
Or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King 
A black Casanova runnin' brothers over like Christine 
When I rock the spot 
With the flavor I got 
I get plenty of ass, so call me an astronaut 
As I blast pass another brother's ass who thought he was strong 
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong 
When I flow fools, know it's time to take a hike 
'Cause I grab the mike 
And flip my tongue like a dike

Produce smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted

You gotta get on down 
Just get on down

But I ain't no politician 
No competition 
Sendin' all opposition 
To see a mortician 
I'm up front, never in the back drop 
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat top

Heavy rollers even the sheisty individuals
Smokin skunk and mad Phillies
Beatin down Billy Badasses, cracks in stacks and masses
If robbery's a class, bet I pass it

Big Poppa never softenin
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offerin
Leave the fucker coughin up blood, and his pockets like rabbit ears

Maxin mini-markets, gettin money with the Arabs

And all the niggas that I'm cool with
Let em all know that my moms is gone 
And it will be tomorrow before she comes back home
Ding-dong it's on, nigga say no more
I'm with a truck full of women so just open the door
Cause yo, we came here to party
Get it crunk, get drunk and leave your house with somebody
True that, so homies don't bring your main misses 
Cause it's real deal mackin when it comes to the Chris's
And this could be your very last time seein her
One look at me and you better believe that I be g'n her
So come alone or don't come at all (why?)
Cause it's real big pimpin at this playa's ball
True it's, usually not represented right
But with me it's all to the g and tonight's the night

But three months later he say he won't date her or return her call
And she swear, ""Goddamn, if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls.""

And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walking through the door
They call her a killer and they call her a sinner and they call her a whore

We're gonna have a problem here.

Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor, like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass, worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Ahh)

It's the return of the, oh wait, no way, you're kidding

And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Haha)

Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you know what
Flippin' to you know who, yeah but he's so cute though

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents bedrooms (Eh-eh-eh)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose

My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit 4th grade, they got the Discovery Channel, don't they
We ain't nothing but mammals, well some of us are cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (Eww)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too

Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe"".

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Ahh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim  Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim  Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all 
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it at all

I just get on the mic and spit it 
And whether you like to admit it, (Rip) I just shit it 
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny

'Cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person, in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' ""I don't give a fuck.""
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time loud as you can, how does it go

He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along
With a flashy nigga braggin on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2 ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in the matrix

A nigga upset for sure 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drinkin' drough

So they get behind me tryin' to check my tags
Look at my rear view and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me on the wrong well keep tryin'
'Cause they denyin' is racial profilin'

Houston, Texas you can check my tags
Pull me over try to check my slab
Glove compartment gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast

And been a baller that I am I talk to them
Givin' a damn 'about not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood

I'm a laugh at you and then I'm a have to cruise
I'm in number two on some more DJ Screw
You can't arrest me plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws tellin' them ""We hate you!""

I can't be toss or tell 'em that they should've known
Tippin' down I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone tryin' to find a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me I'm about to pull up at your home, it's on

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Just remember when you come up

Have you ever had the feeling that you was being had?
Don't that shit make you mad?
They treat you like a slave, with chains all on your soul
And put whips up on your back

They be lying through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk

Unaffected by they threats than get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glittering may not be gold, don't let no body play me

If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Go on and put your hands up, when times are hard you stand up
L-U-P the man, cause a brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us they'll never slow my plans up!

One in the air for the people that ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids who don't wanna be there
None for the niggas trying to hold them back
Five in the air for the teacher not scared
To tell those kids that's living in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs!

Yeah yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world
Now I'm on a world tour
I will give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghettos girls and boys I'm rapping around the world for!

Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour, Oakland out to Auckland
Gaza Strip to Detroit, say hip-hop only destroy
Tell 'em look at me, boy!
I hope your son don't have a gun and that would be a D-boy

No matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass
Picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down
You just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em till your arms tired

Let 'em know you're there
That you struggling and survivin' that you gonna persevere

And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen

Meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in

"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,
I shoved it on down into overdrive.

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin',
And down in the dips she started to rockin'.
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!""",['country'],69,1972,Hot Rod Lincoln,Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen,blue,240,1,1,"(0, 0, 255)","rgb(0, 0, 255)",2sZjmnS1BSoc1svOu5P8LM
"It was raining hard in 'Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light

""Oh where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain""
She just looked out the window
She said, ""Sixteen Parkside Lane""

Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more

It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
And she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile, just the same

And she said, ""How are you Harry?""
I said, ""How are you Sue?
Through the too many miles and the too little smiles
I still remember you.""

It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of the Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far

You see she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off to find the sky

Oh, I've got something inside me
To drive a princess blind
There's a wild man, wizard
He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind.

Oh, I've got something inside me
But it's not what my life's about,
Cause I've been letting my outside tide me
Over 'till my time, runs out

Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes she's flying, afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
Cause she's dying, aren't we all

There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns

And she said we must get together
But I knew it'd never be arranged
And she handed me twenty dollars for a two fifty fare
She said, ""Harry, keep the change.""

Well another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go
I stashed the bill in my shirt

And she walked away in silence
It's strange how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago

You see she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off for the sky

And here, she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips and getting stoned

"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin' home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for ev'ry door

When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away
On the road and hangin' by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long

I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby

Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept the memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude, the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly

But we'll get together then.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play.
Can you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today,
I got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's okay.""
And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed
Said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I'm gonna be like him.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when,
But we'll get together then.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?""
He shook his head and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys.
See you later. Can I have them please?""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when,
But we'll get together then, dad.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

I've long since retired,my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind.""
He said, ""I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time.
You see, my new job's a hassle and the kid's got the flu.
But it's sure nice talking to you, dad.
It's been sure nice talking to you.""
And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when,
But we'll get together then, dad.

"Way on the other side of the Hudson, 
deep in the bosom of suburbia,
I met a young girl, she sang mighty fine, 
Tears on My Pillow and Ave Maria.
Standing by the waterfall in Paramus Park 
she was working for the Friends-of-BAI
She was collecting quarters in a paper cup. 
She was looking for change and so was I.

She was a Jewish girl. I fell in love with her. 
She wrote her number on the back of my hand.
I called her up, I was all out of breath, I said, 
""Come hear me play in my rock and roll band. 
I took a shower and I put on my best blue jeans. 
I picked her up in my new VW van.
She wore a peasant blouse with nothing underneath. 
I said, ""Hi"". She said, ""Yeah, I guess I am."" 

Ariel' 

We had a little time, we were real hungry. 
We went to Dairy Queen for something to eat.
She had some onion rings. She had a pickle. 
She forgot to tell me that she didn't eat meat.
I had a gig in the American Legion Hall. 
It was a dance for the Volunteer Ambulance Corp.
She was sitting in a corner against the wall. 
She would smile and I melted all over the floor. 

Ariel' 

I took her home with me. We watched some TV, 
Annette Funicello and some guy going steady.
I started fooling around with the vertical hold. 
We got the munchies and I made some spaghetti.
We sat and we talked into the night, 
while channel 2 was signing off the air. 
I found the softness of her mouth. 
We made love to bombs bursting in Arrrrrriel'.

"Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stole behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve

She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried

We took her groceries to the checkout stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation dragged

Went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

She said she'd married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie

I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I
Saw doubt or gratitude

She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was hell

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving in our eloquence
Another 'auld lang syne'

The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away

Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And as I turned to make my way back home

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by

But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since Daddy had to fly

Oh, but I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind

You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

O beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king

Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since Daddy had to lie

Oh, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind

And let your hair spill all around me

Now we've come so far, so fast
But somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us

So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye

And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense

A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide

put a lot of people through misery and wreck

Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
but soon as the case started moving slow
what do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill carol collect a big check
Blame it on a black man. What the heck!
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
so he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside!

Little Tiffany. Only thirteen
Came to the city. Place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
and the girls play hopscotch
So far her vacation was top notch
But of the blue a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
and a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died
Innocently on the wildside

Rocked

I'm your average, ordinary, everyday kid
Happy to do nothin'
In fact, that's what I did

I got a million ways to make my day
But daddy don't agree
'Cause when I try to get away he says
He got plans for me

(""Get your butt right out of bed"") Stop buggin' me
(""Get up and move your sleepy head"") Don't shake my tree

He said, (""Mow the lawn"") Who, me?
(""Walk the dog"") Not my style, man
(""Take out the trash"") No way
(""Tidy your room"") C'mon get real

I'm sorry dad, gotta disappear
Let's get the rock outta here

In at the deep end, hang on tight
Won't take a minute, won't take long

I'm your average, ordinary, everyday dude
Drivin' with my baby
To get her in the mood

She's dialin' through my radio
And I'm ready to make my move
But what she got ain't rock 'n' roll
And it really blew my groove

It was (Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven)
It makes me wanna scream
(Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins)
Turn it off) That ain't my scene

Well, I'm sorry girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question?

Seven-day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

Every time I want to love you I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancin' with this broom

I feel lucky today
Hey, look at that man

"--Chorus--
I shot the sheriff
--Chorus--

Verse One:

I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
he mistaked me for somebody who was liable
for all tha many murders l.a and war fields
we keep makin war shields
streets keep souls
young brothers loose control
I seem to maintain through this
watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist
and it aint nobody like my down ass hommie
and tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
they do crime and it attracts cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in

--Chorus--

Verse Two:

They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do
you know who
the boys in blue
there they go with they assumpitons
slaverys over let us have somethin'
why you wanna pull me over?
Cuz I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
my profession is music
your profession is protection with gats
then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in

--Chorus--

Verse Three:

I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
Cuz in this game they always tryin' to blast you
and leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
they harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
the hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
cuz I'm gonna work for life
so he can see another day
a hommies a hommie
a fake is a snake
straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops

When you shopping did you shop for 2

Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back
Treat you like you're all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbing all day and all night
Just to save a fight

And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in you life
Even though he gave you ice gown that will make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
Then he give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me
Cuz Mase ain't the player with the PhD

When the trees are crowned with leaves
When the ash and oak, and the birch and yew
Are dressed in ribbons fair

When owls call the breathless moon
In the blue veil of the night
The shadows of the trees appear
Amidst the lantern light

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

Who will go down to those shady groves
And summon the shadows there
And tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms
In the springtime of the year

The songs of birds seem to fill the wood
When the fiddler plays
All their voices can be heard
Long past their woodland days

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

And so they linked their hands and danced
Round in circles and in rows
And so the journey of the night descends
When all the shades are gone

A garland gay we bring you here
And at your door we stand
Here's a sprout well budded out
The work of our Lord's hand

And some time of this day

(Lil' Mo) If I can go, with you
(Angie M) Yo, yo, uh

(Verse 1: Angie Martinez)
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

(Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

(Verse 2: Sacario)
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you

If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all

(Bridge: Lil' Mo)
You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

(Martinez Angie)
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

(Sacario)
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

(Angie+S)
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few

(Sacario)
Go 'head

Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?

(Sacario)
Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

(Sacario)
And the shop's there?

(Martinez Angie)
If they don't got em, they don't make em

((Sacario:) True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore


This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrased to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self destruct


Baby smile today
Cuz I been on that journey always
I'm gon' luv u better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' luv u better


When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know




Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together


It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin's gonna tear us apart, promise

"Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon lights
The corner bar
It just seemed right, so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep 
Down at the end lookin' half asleep 
He walked up and said ""What'll it be?""
I said,""The good stuff""
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said, ""You can't find that here.""

'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date
Your momma's all worried when you get home late
Droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shakin so much
And it's the way that she looks with rice in her hair
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk 
And he poured a glass
Then I smiled and said,
""I'll have some of that.""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends
Saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed.""
He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me,
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new t-shirt saying ""I'm a grandpa""
And being right there as our time got small
And holdin' her hand when the good Lord called her up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff

He said, ""When you get home she'll start to cry,
When she says, 'I'm sorry,' say 'So am I'
Then look into those eyes so deep in love
And drink it up

"Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

"Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore

Anymore

I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Something about you caught my eye
Something moved me deep inside

Don't know what you did, boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since

I told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friend
Told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense
That every time I see you everything starts making sense

Tell the others, your lovers, better not be present tense
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no-one else's

If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me.

Mother: Hi Justin! This is your mother. It's 2:33 on Monday afternoon. I was just calling to see how you were doing. You sounded really uptight last night, it made me a little nervous, and well it made me nervous that it sounded like you were nervous too.I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too. You know I love ya! Take care honey I know you're under a lot of pressure. See ya. Bye, bye!

I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head, that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face
And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

I'm sober now for three whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I'll never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry, and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, ""Make it go away""
Just make her smile come back and shine, just like it used to be
And then she whispered, ""How can you do this to me?""

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
For you
For you
For you

A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check two one two
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?
Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me
I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know

Lupe Fiasco
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid
And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise 
They want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Matthew Santos
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show

Lupe Fiasco
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow 
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autographed picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha...
Ha ha ha ha ha...ha

And let your hair down

Cause you’ll have to leave

When purple colored curtains
Mark the end of the day

As day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender

We keep our rendez-vous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way

"A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now, do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book on Marx
A quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry 
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, secondhand and rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker (Ho!)

They be like ""Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!""
I'm like ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business (Ho!)
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't (Ho!)
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand, man, you hella won't (Ho!)
Man, you hella won't

Ho!

(Goodwill... poppin' tags... yeah)

Ow, ow

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome (Ho!)

I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big ass coat 
From that thrift shop down the road

I wear your granddad's clothes (damn right)
I look incredible (Now, c'mon, man)
I'm in this big ass coat (big ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (let's go)

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome (Ho!)

"I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

You can't shoot me down cause you've already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road just as far as you wanna go
Baby, I'll do, whatever you wanna do, wanna do

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild

"Double wide Quick Stop, midnight T-top
Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and daddy put their roots right here
'Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dog school bus kickin' up red dust
Pickin' us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the vents

We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
Born in the U.S.A.
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to L.A.
We were teenage dreamin', front seat leanin'
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown, down home American kids
Growin' up in little pink houses
Makin' out on living room couches
Blowin' that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we're all alright

Baptist church parkin' lot, tryin' not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin' it to second base, but sayin' you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice

Sisters got a boyfriend Daddy doesn't like
Now he's sittin' out back, 3030 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light

We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
Born in the U.S.A.
